            <p>Puffins are any of three small species of alcids (auks) in the bird genus Fratercula with a brightly coloured beak during the breeding season. These are pelagic seabirds that feed primarily by diving in the water. They breed in large colonies on coastal cliffs or offshore islands, nesting in crevices among rocks or in burrows in the soil. Two species, the tufted puffin and horned puffin, are found in the North Pacific Ocean, while the Atlantic puffin is found in the North Atlantic Ocean.</p>

            <img src="./Animal Wiki_files/quetzal.jpg" alt="picture of a quetzal">
            <p>Quetzals are found in forests, especially in humid highlands, with the five species from the genus Pharomachrus being exclusively Neotropical, while a single species, Euptilotis neoxenus, is found in Mexico and very locally in southern United States.[1] They are fairly large (all over 32 cm or 13 inches long), slightly bigger than other trogon species.</p>

            <h3>Sloths</h3>
            <img src="./Animal Wiki_files/sloth.jpg" alt="picture of a sloth and baby hanging from a tree">
            <p>Sloths are arboreal mammals noted for slowness of movement and for spending most of their lives hanging upside down in the trees of the tropical rainforests of South America and Central America. The six species are in two families: two-toed sloths and three-toed sloths. In spite of this traditional naming, all sloths actually have three toes. The two-toed sloths have two digits, or fingers, on each forelimb.</p>
